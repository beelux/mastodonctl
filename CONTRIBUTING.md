# contributing to mastodonctl

## basic guideline

0. users are 100% welcome to open an issue for a `bug` report
1. new contributors are 100% welcome to comment and open a PR for `help wanted`
   and `good first contribution` labels
2. regular contributors will either take on an existing issue located in 'To
   Do' column or discuss with socraticDev about something they want to do

socraticDev remains the benevolent dictator of this project and wont accept PR
outside the scope of the project.

## Project board is the truth
